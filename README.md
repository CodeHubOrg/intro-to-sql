# Intro to SQL

This repo contains support for the "Intro to SQL" online workshops run by the
[Bristol CodeHub](https://www.codehub.org.uk). The focus is on downloading the
[non-commercial IMDB
datafiles](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/) and compiling
them into directly importable files.
